<p><strong>Date:</strong> June 21, 2025<br></br><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V979Wd1gmTU" target="_blank">YouTube Interview</a></p>
<p><em>"We said, 'Okay, we're going to go for AGI.' 99% of the world thought we were crazy. 1% of the world really resonated with it. In 10 or 20 years, unless something goes hugely wrong, we'll have unimaginable super intelligence. This is the best time ever in the history of technology, period, to start a company."</em></p>
<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reflects on the company's improbable journey from an eight-person research lab to creating ChatGPT, and shares his vision for the future of artificial intelligence, entrepreneurship, and human potential.</p>
<h2 id="the-improbable-beginning">The Improbable Beginning</h2>
<p>Looking back, it's hard to explain how improbable OpenAI seemed at the time. We got very close to not starting the company at all. AGI sounded crazy—I had Gary's job then, and there were all these other great startups that would definitely work, while AGI felt like a pipe dream. Even if it was possible, DeepMind seemed impossibly far ahead.</p>
<p>We spent the entire year of 2015 talking about whether to start it, and it was genuinely coin-flippy. This is the story of many ambitious things—they seem so difficult, with so many good reasons not to do them, that it really takes a core of people who sit in a room, look each other in the eye, and say, "All right, let's do this." Those are very important moments, and when in doubt, you should lean into them.</p>
<p>It's hard to remember what the AI landscape looked like 10 years ago. This was way before the first language models that actually worked. We were trying to play video games with AI and had this little robotic hand that could sort of barely do a Rubik's cube. We had no ideas for products, no revenue, no real idea that we would ever have revenue. We sat around conference tables and whiteboards trying to come up with ideas for papers to write.</p>
<p>The idea of ChatGPT was completely in the realm of science fiction. It's hard to explain now because it looks so obvious, but at the time, it seemed impossibly improbable.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-the-1-who-believed">Gathering the 1% Who Believed</h2>
<p>The challenge of recruiting top talent was actually easier than it sounds. If you say you're going to do something crazy that's exciting and important if it works, and other people aren't doing it, you can actually get a lot of people together.</p>
<p>We said, "Okay, we're going to go for AGI." While 99% of the world thought we were crazy, 1% really resonated with the idea. There were a lot of smart people in that 1%, and there wasn't really anywhere else for them to go. So we could concentrate the talent around a mission that people cared about.</p>
<p>We've observed this many times with startups: if you're doing the same thing as everyone else, it's very hard to concentrate talent and get people to really believe in a mission. But if you're doing a one-of-one thing, you have a really nice tailwind.</p>
<h2 id="starting-small-dreaming-big">Starting Small, Dreaming Big</h2>
<p>OpenAI was not an "OpenAI-scale thing" off the bat. It was eight people in a room, then 20 people in a room, and it was very unclear what to do. We were just trying to write good research papers.</p>
<p>The things that eventually become really big do not start off that way. I think it's important to dream that it could be big if it works, but nothing big starts that way. Vinod Khosla has a quote I've always liked: there's a very big difference between a zero million dollar startup and a zero billion dollar startup, but they both have zero dollars of revenue. They're both just a few people sitting in a room, both trying to get the first thing to work.</p>
<p>The only advice I have about trying to start something big is to pick a market where there's some version of the future where it could be big if it works. But other than that, it's just one dumb foot in front of the other for a long time.</p>
<h2 id="the-product-overhang-moment">The Product Overhang Moment</h2>
<p>We're in a really interesting time right now—we haven't been in one of these for a while. The product overhang relative to what the models are capable of is enormous. The models' capabilities are way up here, while the products that people have figured out to build are way down here.</p>
<p>Even if the models got no better (which of course they will), there's a huge amount of new stuff to build. Last week, GPT-4o cost five times as much as it did this week, and that's going to keep improving. I think people will be astonished at how much the price-performance ratio falls.</p>
<p>We have an open source model coming out soon, and I think people are going to be astonished. It will be much better than you're hoping for, and the ability to use it to run incredibly powerful models locally is going to really surprise people.</p>
<p>You have this world where model capability has gone into a very new realm, the cost of APIs will keep falling dramatically, the open source models are going to be great, and we haven't yet seen the level of new product innovation that reasoning models are capable of. This makes it an exceptional time to build a company that takes advantage of this new capability—this new square on the periodic table that no one has built with yet.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-toward-her">The Evolution Toward "Her"</h2>
<p>Memory is my favorite feature we've launched this year. I don't think most people at OpenAI would say that because we've launched a lot of stuff, but I love memory in ChatGPT. It points to where we'll hopefully go with the product: you'll have this entity that gets to know you, connects to all your stuff, and proactively helps you.</p>
<p>It won't just be sending a message and getting one back. It'll be running all the time, looking at your stuff, knowing when to send you a message, knowing when to go do something on your behalf. You'll have special new devices, and it'll be integrated into every other service you use. You'll just have this thing running with you throughout your life.</p>
<p>When people ask when "Her" is coming, the answer is gradually. It's a little bit here with memory. It'll be a little more here when it's persistently running in the background. It'll be a lot more here when we ship the first new device. But the key isn't the hardware—it's that this thing reaches a point where it can run in the background and feel like an AI companion.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-human-computer-interaction">The Future of Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
<p>I think sci-fi got right the idea that the interface almost melts away. Voice interfaces today feel sucky because they don't work well, but in theory, if you could say to a computer, "This is exactly what I want to happen today, and if there are any changes—if I'm delayed, if something happens—I trust you to go off and do all those things without interrupting me or making me think about it," and it just did it all reliably, that would be an interface that almost melted away.</p>
<p>When I use my phone today, I feel like I'm walking down Times Square getting bumped by people. I love my phone—it's incredible technology—but it's notification here, this thing happening, something popping up, bright colors, flashing things. It's just stressful.</p>
<p>I can imagine an interface where the computer mostly melts away, does the stuff I need, and I really trust it to surface information appropriately, make judgment calls about when not to interrupt, and act on my behalf when it should. I'm quite excited for that.</p>
<h2 id="the-robotics-horizon">The Robotics Horizon</h2>
<p>Our strategy has been to nail the intelligence first, then make sure we can connect that to a robot. But the time for robots is coming soon. I'm very excited about a world where when you sign up for the highest tier of ChatGPT subscription, we send you a free humanoid robot too.</p>
<p>That future is going to be pretty wild—being able to have robots that do real work in the real world. I think we're not that far away now. The mechanical engineering of robots has been quite difficult, and the AI for the cognitive part has been quite difficult too, but it feels within grasp. In a few years, robots will start to do super useful stuff.</p>
<p>Making a billion robots is still going to take a while, but I'm interested in the question: how many robots do you need to fully automate the supply chain? If you make a million humanoid robots the old-fashioned way, can they run the entire supply chain—drive the mining equipment, the container ships, run the foundries, and make new robots? Maybe you actually can get a lot of robots in the world quickly.</p>
<h2 id="defensibility-in-the-age-of-ai">Defensibility in the Age of AI</h2>
<p>The number one question in our chat is: "How do I start a startup that doesn't get run over by OpenAI?" Look, we're going to do our thing hopefully very well. We're going to try to make the best super assistant out of ChatGPT that we can, and we're going to add the things we think we need to add to that.</p>
<p>But that's one small part of the opportunity in front of us. It makes us sad when people say they're going to start a new startup and make a version of ChatGPT, because we think we're going to do that pretty well and we have a big head start. But there's so much more space to go after, and there are so many incredible other companies that have been built using our platform.</p>
<p>Our advice is: don't build our core chat assistant. But there's another problem—and this is the same for every moment I've seen in startup history: people get excited about the same thing at the same time. Rather than build the thing you've thought of that nobody else is doing, we're social creatures and get influenced by what others are doing.</p>
<p>I bet if Gary listed off the five ideas he hears most often about what people want to build with AI, half this room would raise their hands for working on one of those five. There is hopefully someone in this room who's going to start a company much bigger than OpenAI someday, and I'd bet that person is not working on any of the five.</p>
<p>It's hard to build something defensible if everybody else is trying to do the same thing. The most enduring companies are usually not doing the same thing as everybody else. That gives you time to figure out what the great product is and how to build the technology before you have to answer the defensibility question.</p>
<p>It took us a long time to figure out how to answer the defensibility question for ChatGPT. We had built this thing, and for a long time the only defensibility was that we had the only product out in the market. Then we kind of built a brand that started to be well-known, and now we have things like memory and connections that really are defensible. But that was a fair criticism of us for a long time—we didn't have any defensibility strategy. We just had the only good thing out there, and then you have some window before you have to build defensibility.</p>
<h2 id="the-courage-of-contrarian-conviction">The Courage of Contrarian Conviction</h2>
<p>Peter Thiel is a genius, and being contrarian but right is incredibly valuable. But it's hard to have conviction in the face of a lot of other people telling you you're wrong. People who say it's easy aren't being honest. It gets easier over time, but it's genuinely difficult.</p>
<p>I remember one time—I can say this because it got publicized—a few years into OpenAI, Elon sent us this really mean email. We'd been working together for a while, and he said we had a zero percent chance of success. Not low—zero. We were totally failing. We had showed him GPT-1 recently, and he was like, "This is crap. It's not going to work. Doesn't make sense."</p>
<p>He was a real hero of mine at the time. I remember going home that night and thinking, "What if he's right? This sucks." You're working so hard on something, pouring your life force into it, and you have these people who are smart and whom you look up to saying, "You are totally wrong."</p>
<p>I don't have a magic answer other than it's really tough and it gets significantly easier over time, but it's going to happen to all of you. You just get knocked down, get back up, brush yourself off, and try to keep going.</p>
<h2 id="the-dawn-of-agent-workflows">The Dawn of Agent Workflows</h2>
<p>For a long time, ChatGPT was like a Google replacement. You could ask it something about as long as a Google query—maybe half an hour worth of Google queries assembled together. That was still pretty good, but it felt like a more advanced version of search.</p>
<p>But now you start to see things where you can really give a task to Code Interpreter or to Deep Research and have this thing go off, do a bunch of stuff, and come back to you with a proposal. It's like a very junior employee that can work on something for a short period of time.</p>
<p>If you think about how much of the work that the world does is work that can be done in front of a computer in few-hour chunks where someone then says "okay, that was good enough or not," it's quite a lot. I think this is going to go quite far, and with current GPT-4o—to say nothing of our next model—you can build a lot of experiences like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-time-ever-to-start-a-company">The Best Time Ever to Start a Company</h2>
<p>This is the best time ever in the history of technology, period, to start a company. Part of the reason it's the best is because the ground is shaking, and there are a lot of challenges. You can look at just-in-time software generation and say, "We've been a SaaS company, and now all the code can just be generated right when someone needs it—what does that mean for us?"</p>
<p>Or you can look at it and say, "Wow, this is going to happen, but it's going to happen to everybody. The way startups win is when they can iterate faster than big companies and do it at much lower cost." Big companies have a lot of advantages, but they iterate very slowly, and when something is very cheap, a lot of their big advantages go away.</p>
<p>You can look at all these problems one way or another, but I'd recommend looking at them this way: everybody is going to face the same challenges and opportunities. When the clock cycle of the industry changes this much, startups almost always win, and we've probably never seen it change this much.</p>
<h2 id="the-age-of-intelligence-and-abundance">The Age of Intelligence and Abundance</h2>
<p>The whole arc of technology is one story: we discover more science, build better tools, and all of society builds the scaffolding a little bit higher. We have this more impressive toolchain, and the whole point is that one person can do way more than they could before. This has been going on for a long time.</p>
<p>One of the things that will feel most different about the next 10 years versus the last 10 years is how much a single person or small group of people with a lot of agency can get done. That's a bigger deal than it sounds because coordination costs are huge. When we can empower people with more knowledge, more tools, more resources, I think we won't just see a little bit more stuff get built—because of coordination costs across people, we'll see a real step change.</p>
<p>The amount that one person or small team can get done, the satisfaction in doing that, and most importantly, the quality of stuff we'll all get for each other will be quite remarkable.</p>
<h2 id="ai-for-science-the-ultimate-frontier">AI for Science: The Ultimate Frontier</h2>
<p>Looking ahead 10 to 20 years, unless something goes hugely wrong, we'll have unimaginable super intelligence. Forced to pick one thing I'm personally most excited about: AI for science.</p>
<p>I believe that to a first-order approximation, all long-term sustainable economic growth in the world—everything that leads to people's lives getting better—is basically discovering new science and having reasonably good governance and institutions so that science can get developed and shared with the world.</p>
<p>If we could vastly increase the rate of new scientific discovery with AI, I believe that would compound to incredible increases and wonders for everyone's lives. So I'd pick that on that time frame.</p>
<h2 id="energy-and-intelligence-the-twin-vectors">Energy and Intelligence: The Twin Vectors</h2>
<p>I've been obsessed with energy and AI as the two things that I thought would be the most important things for a long time—the two areas I wanted to concentrate time and capital toward. But I cannot recall ever thinking until after starting OpenAI that they were going to be so obviously related, that energy would eventually be the fundamental limiter on how much intelligence we could have.</p>
<p>I really did think of them as very independent—we were going to need AI to have all the ideas, energy to make all the stuff happen in the world. But obviously right after starting OpenAI, I got obsessed with needing energy for AI. Pre-2015, I thought of them as orthogonal vectors.</p>
<p>Now I think a lot about how much energy we can actually build on Earth before we just heat the planet too much from running the GPUs, and how long we can go before we have to put all the GPUs in space.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-for-the-next-generation">Lessons for the Next Generation</h2>
<p>I wish someone had taught me the importance of conviction and resilience over a long period of time. People don't really talk about how hard that is. It's easy for a little while, but your reserves wear down, and learning how to keep that going for a long period is crucial.</p>
<p>Also, trust that it's eventually going to work out. Obviously my first startup didn't work that well. A lot of people give up after one failed startup, but startups don't work out all the time. Learning how to keep going through that, keep working through that, is really important.</p>
<p>Developing trust in your own instincts and increasing that trust as you refine your decision-making over time is critical. Having courage to work on stuff that is out of fashion but is what you believe and care about—that's really important.</p>
<p>I had a kid recently, and the thing everyone tells you is that it's the best thing you'll ever do but also the hardest thing you'll ever do. The good parts are much better than you can imagine, and the hard parts are much harder. That's all totally true, and that's also basically what I feel like being an entrepreneur is like. The good parts are really great—better than you think—and the hard parts are shockingly much harder than anyone can express in a way that makes sense to you. You just have to keep going.</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-of-the-transistor-analogy">The Magic of the Transistor Analogy</h2>
<p>The analogy I like most for AI is the transistor. Some people figured out a new, really important scientific discovery, and society—the economy, whatever you want to call it—just got to work. The magic of that system figured out how to make incredible value for people and really, over a fairly short period of decades, significantly ramp up quality of life.</p>
<p>I think this will be even faster and steeper than that, but it'll go directionally the same way. We need to make great technology, figure out the remaining scientific stuff (which I don't think there's much left), figure out how to build out the infrastructure that you all will need to be able to service, and then you all have to go figure out what people in the world need with this new magic.</p>
<p>Almost five years ago, pretty much this week, we put GPT-3 into an API and people started playing with it. It was barely usable and quite embarrassing. In five years, we've gone from this thing that could barely write a sentence to something with PhD-level intelligence in most areas. Five more years, I think we'll be able to maintain the same rate of progress.</p>
<p>If we also build out the infrastructure to serve that to people, then everybody in this room will figure out how to take that technology and adapt it to what everybody needs. You're the thin edge of the spear—literally teaching people and giving them this technology. That's a great place to be.</p>
