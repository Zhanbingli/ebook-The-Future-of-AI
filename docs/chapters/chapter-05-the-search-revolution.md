# Chapter 5: The Search Revolution

*Aravind Srinivas on Building Agentic Search*

### The Accidental Entrepreneur

Aravind Srinivas never intended to challenge Google's dominance in search. His journey to founding Perplexity began with a simple observation: despite the incredible advances in AI and machine learning, there was still no good way to search Twitter. "I love Twitter as a platform, so there's no good way to search over Twitter. There still is no good way to search over Twitter," he reflects.

This seemingly narrow problem—creating better search for social media—would eventually evolve into something much more ambitious: rebuilding search from the ground up for the AI era. The path from Twitter search to taking on Google illustrates how the most significant startups often begin by solving specific, concrete problems before expanding to transform entire industries.

### The Foundation of Speed

What sets Srinivas apart in the competitive landscape of AI applications is his relentless focus on execution speed. "You have to innovate. You have to move faster than everybody else. And it's like running a marathon but at an extremely high velocity," he explains. "The only mode you have is speed."

This philosophy emerged from a clear-eyed assessment of Perplexity's competitive position. Every major tech company—OpenAI, Google, Anthropic—has both the resources and motivation to build similar capabilities. In such an environment, sustainable advantage comes not from having a secret sauce that others can't replicate, but from consistently out-executing competitors in delivering value to users.

### The Browser as Platform

Srinivas's most audacious bet for Perplexity's future involves building a browser that serves as a "cognitive operatingsystem" rather than just another web navigation tool. "We think about it as an assistant rather than a complete autonomous agent but one omni box where you can navigate you can ask informational queries and you can give agentic tasks," he explains.

This vision extends far beyond traditional search. Imagine launching parallel processes that research real estate markets, analyze investment opportunities, and coordinate social media accounts—all running asynchronously in browser tabs like a personal AI workforce. "That's never been possible before. And Chrome was exciting when each tab was its own process. You think about each query or each prompt could be that."

### The Innovator's Dilemma in Action

Perhaps nowhere is the innovator's dilemma more visible than in Google's response to AI-powered search. Despite having superior technical resources and talent, Google faces fundamental conflicts between innovation and their existing business model. "If people can get answers to best hotels to stay in San Francisco with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge... with booking links right there, how are you going to make money from Booking and Expedia and Kayak?" Srinivas asks.

This conflict manifests in Google's pattern of announcing similar features year after year under different names—AI Overview, AI Mode—without fully launching them to all users. "The same feature is being launched year after year with a different name, with a different VP, with a different group of people, but it's the same thing," Srinivas observes.

### The Data Advantage

One of Perplexity's key insights involves the relationship between scale and diversity in training data. While industrial automation provides massive scale—robots performing identical tasks millions of times—it lacks the behavioral diversity needed for general intelligence. Similarly, foundation models trained primarily on web text excel at language understanding but struggle with the nuanced requirements of search and factual accuracy.

Perplexity's approach involves combining multiple data sources and training specialized models for different aspects of the search experience. They train models not just for generating answers, but for understanding queries, retrieving relevant information, and synthesizing responses with appropriate citations and confidence levels.

### Beyond Chat: The Agent Future

While most AI companies focus on conversational interfaces, Srinivas sees this as just the beginning. "It feels intuitively like we're in the MS DOS era of AI right now. If you look back 10 years from now, everyone's going to go, can you believe that we just had this chat box?"

The next phase involves agents that can complete multi-step tasks autonomously. Srinivas envisions systems that can schedule meetings, reply to emails, filter applications based on complex criteria, and perform other routine cognitive work. "You can schedule your meetings, you can reply to some of your emails that you don't even want to read," he describes as basic examples of what browser-based agents will enable.

### The Integration Challenge

Building effective AI agents requires solving complex integration challenges that go far beyond language model capabilities. Perplexity already works with numerous partners—Selfbook for hotel bookings, TripAdvisor for reviews, Shopify for commerce, various financial and sports data providers—to create a comprehensive information ecosystem.

The browser approach offers unique advantages for integration. Rather than requiring every service to build specialized APIs for AI agents, a browser-based system can interact with existing web interfaces just as humans do. "The agent is the one that's being permitted by the user to act on their behalf. And if there is no MCP server, it's still fine. You can just use these tabs as if the user would have done it."

### Business Model Innovation

Perplexity's business model evolution reflects the broader transformation of how people access and pay for information. Moving beyond traditional subscription models, they're exploring usage-based pricing for agent tasks and transaction-based revenue for commerce activities.

"Usage-based pricing where people are paying an agent for completing a task or people have recurring tasks and they pay based on every single use of the task and they normalize this system based on how much it would take to hire a person to do that for them," Srinivas explains.

This pricing philosophy—anchoring AI services to the cost of human alternatives—could establish sustainable economics for increasingly sophisticated AI applications.

### The Technical Architecture

Behind Perplexity's user-facing simplicity lies sophisticated technical architecture designed for accuracy and speed. The system combines multiple models: retrieval models for finding relevant information, reasoning models for synthesizing answers, and citation models for attribution and verification.

"We focus a lot on accuracy at the level of answers, accuracy at the level of tasks, orchestrating all these different tools," Srinivas emphasizes. This multi-model approach allows optimization for different aspects of the search experience while maintaining overall system reliability.

### Competitive Moats in the AI Era

Traditional startup wisdom emphasizes building defensive moats, but Srinivas takes a different approach. "Brand definitely has a big value... once you acquire at the scale of several millions of users, paying users, you don't actually die that fast. You earn the right to survive and keep building."

Rather than relying on traditional network effects or data advantages, Perplexity's moat emerges from execution quality and user trust. "Narrative is very important to the brand... we are the most focused on getting as many answers right as possible, we focus on speed, time to first token... we're still the fastest despite doing search."

### The Challenge of Hallucinations

One of the persistent challenges in AI-powered search involves managing hallucinations—instances where models generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information. Perplexity addresses this through multiple approaches: building comprehensive search indexes, capturing better snippets from web pages, and using multi-step reasoning to verify claims.

"The only way there is to keep building a better search index, keep capturing better snippets of all the web pages, and then these models are getting fast enough that you can have them reason multi-step for every query without incurring too much cost," Srinivas explains.

### Learning from Users

Perhaps the most valuable aspect of building in public involves learning from user behavior and feedback. Srinivas actively reads social media responses to product launches, using both praise and criticism to guide development priorities. "I read all the Twitter comments every time... I love it actually because they know that they're all thinking."

This direct feedback loop allows rapid iteration and helps identify features that users actually want versus those that sound good in strategy documents. The willingness to engage directly with user criticism, rather than delegating it to support teams, provides founders with crucial insights about product-market fit.

### The Global Perspective

As AI capabilities democratize access to information and computation, Srinivas sees opportunities extending far beyond English-speaking markets. Building truly global AI applications requires understanding different information needs, cultural contexts, and regulatory environments across diverse markets.

The browser-based approach offers advantages for international expansion since web standards and protocols work consistently across different regions, while mobile app distribution faces platform-specific and regulatory challenges in various markets.

### Advice for AI Entrepreneurs

Srinivas's experience competing directly with tech giants offers valuable lessons for other AI entrepreneurs:

**Embrace the Fear**: "I think you got to live with that fear. You have to embrace it and realize that your mode comes from moving fast and building your own identity around what you're doing."

**Focus on One Thing**: "There's only a limited amount of things you can be world class at... this is the only thing we care about."

**Work Incredibly Hard**: "There is no substitute for it. Don't think you're very smart, strategizing the right way to build a company despite what big model labs are doing."

**Assume Competition**: "You should assume that if you have a big hit, if your company is something that can make revenue on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars or potentially billions of dollars, you should always assume that a model company will copy it."

### The Broader Transformation

Perplexity's growth represents more than just a new search engine—it signals a fundamental shift in how people access and interact with information. The move from query-based search to answer-based systems reflects changing user expectations and capabilities enabled by large language models.

This transformation creates ripple effects throughout the information ecosystem. Publishers, advertisers, and platform companies must all adapt to a world where users increasingly expect direct answers rather than lists of links to explore.

### Technical Innovation at Scale

Operating at Perplexity's scale—with infrastructure issues arising daily due to growing usage—provides unique insights into the practical challenges of deploying AI systems. "I have infra issues every day. So there are a lot of people using it and this usage is actually growing to the extent that we don't actually know how to deal with it."

These operational challenges, while stressful, validate product-market fit in ways that user surveys or engagement metrics cannot. When people use your product enough to strain your infrastructure, you've clearly built something valuable.

### Looking Forward

As Perplexity evolves from search engine to browser to agent platform, Srinivas maintains focus on the fundamental goal: helping people get accurate answers to their questions as quickly as possible. "The perfect blend of AI, navigation, and agents is what we're going to offer. And might sound like a boring answer, but no one's done that."

The browser bet represents a significant technical and strategic risk, but it also offers the potential for sustainable differentiation in an increasingly crowded AI landscape. By building a new platform rather than just another application, Perplexity positions itself to capture value from the entire ecosystem of AI-powered workflows.

The success of this vision will ultimately depend on execution—the same relentless focus on speed and user value that has carried Perplexity from a Twitter search tool to a legitimate challenger to Google's search dominance. In an industry where technical capabilities rapidly converge, the ability to consistently deliver superior user experiences may prove to be the most durable competitive advantage of all.
