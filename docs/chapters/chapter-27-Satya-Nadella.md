*"What are the tools that we can put in the hands of people that will give them that sense of empowerment? That's what I would love to work on. I'm not into this anthropomorphizing AI at all. I come at it as it's a tool."*

Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella shares his perspective on AI's transformational impact, from platform strategy to the future of software development, in this comprehensive discussion about building the next generation of intelligent tools.

## AI as the Fourth Platform Revolution

At Microsoft, we approach AI through three dimensions: as a platform company, a product company, and a partner company. Having lived through client-server, web internet, mobile, and cloud over my 35 years in the industry, I see AI as the fourth major platform shift. The fascinating aspect is the compounding effects of all these platforms.

The reason AI's diffusion rate is so fast and wide is because it builds on the previous generation. If the cloud hadn't existed, we wouldn't have been able to build the AI supercomputers that led to the models that led to the products. This compounding effect drives us to always take the previous platform and build the next platform correctly, then build next-generation products on top of it.

With each platform shift comes a new workload. When I first encountered large-scale training jobs, it represented a completely different workload from what we built the cloud for—a data parallel synchronous workload that's radically different from, say, a Hadoop job. The platform itself gets completely re-architected and changed.

This is the golden age of system software. For anyone building at the infrastructure layer—not just hyperscalers but even startups—there's tremendous opportunity at the model side and in products built on top of it. Ultimately, it's all for one thing: driving economic growth and GDP growth. My benchmark for AI is whether it's creating surplus in the world around us, one community, one country, one industry, one company at a time.

## The Model Layer: SQL for AI

We're at an interesting moment where models have emerged impressively, but compute and applications need to catch up. One key question is whether the model is like SQL or the SaaS app itself. Where does the model end and where does the product begin?

If you consider a model with scaffolding and tool calling in some infinite loop as the product, that's like saying SQL with business logic is an application. It's still possible to build an application tier on top of a model by abstracting yourself and treating the model like SQL was for databases.

I've always dreamed of a moment when AI/machine learning would have a "SQL moment." For the first time in this model layer, we have something like a SQL engine that we can use to build sophisticated products. These techniques—inference time compute plus tool calling—are giving us a robust harness for building sophisticated applications.

The model is an important piece, but there's also model scaffolding, tool calling, and what amounts to a real app server needed to build sophisticated applications. The interesting part is the feedback loop—the data path inside the product that's then used for post-training and proper tool selection. This seems to be where product creation will happen.

## The Energy Equation and Social Permission

AI scaling laws continue to hold, and the demand for intelligence appears potentially infinite. As models become not just larger but more intelligent and capable of complex multi-agent interactions, we must consider the compute infrastructure demands.

If you step back and consider that compute consumes maybe 2-3% of energy in the United States today, and that doubles to 6%, that represents a massive increase in energy production needed for AI. History teaches us that if you're going to use energy, you need social permission to use it. This means ensuring AI output is socially useful.

If we're not creating social surplus and economic surplus as measured by countries and communities, we simply can't justify consuming energy. The real question for the next five years isn't just energy production—it's producing enough products that create great value. I'm confident this will happen in healthcare, education, and productivity across many domains.

The real challenge for our tech industry is proving unequivocally that what we've created shows up in real statistics—not just AGI or AI benchmarks, but in things you interact with daily. Whether it's getting a mortgage loan without three months of waiting and uncertainty, or eliminating the paperwork and bureaucracy that drowns important parts of life, these improvements need to be measurable.

Take healthcare, which represents 18-19% of U.S. GDP. Much of the cost isn't in "magical drugs" but in workflow inefficiencies. Something as simple as discharge processing—taking the back end of an EMR system with an LLM and a prompt—will save enormous time, money, and energy, paying for itself directly. Every dollar spent on clerical work could have been spent on treatment that saves lives, and every hour a physician spends away from paperwork could be spent with patients.

## The Rate Limiter: Change Management

The biggest rate limiter for AI deployment today isn't technical—it's change management. Consider how multinational companies once did sales forecasts: sending faxes, creating inter-office memos, annotations, hoping for results before quarter-end. Then suddenly, with email, PCs, and Excel, you could send a spreadsheet via email and have instant forecasts. The work artifact and workflow changed completely.

This same transformation needs to happen with AI. When someone directs 99 agents on their behalf, the workflow won't remain constant. The scope of jobs will change fundamentally. This change management represents a real rate limiter because you're taking the means of production in insurance, financial services, healthcare, and software companies and changing everything about how work gets done.

At LinkedIn, they've combined design, front-end engineering, and product functions into "full-stack builders"—a change in job scope itself. Rebuilding product teams with new roles and scopes becomes the primary social rate limiter.

This is why many AI startups now employ forward deployment engineers—following the Palantir model. You need to help customers and partners understand not just the technology benefits but how to integrate the technology into workflows.

## The Understated Opportunity in Knowledge Work

One of the most understated opportunities for anyone creating products or fundamental breakthroughs, even at the model layer, is the amount of drudgery in knowledge work. In software engineering, we've seen how much time is spent out of flow state. Staying in flow to complete tasks represents what will happen across all knowledge work.

The amount of cycles spent "out of band" collecting information is staggering. The time actually spent on prefrontal cortex synthesis work is remarkably low. Having a sophisticated reasoning model work alongside your prefrontal cortex, while mundane tasks get handled by agents, represents the real frontier.

Many knowledge work jobs involve copying and pasting from browsers into spreadsheets into emails, then clicking send. These aren't jobs requiring your highest cognitive abilities—they're digital versions of what we used to call "paper pushing," except now people are "email pushing" and "file attaching" to get business done.

## Transformational Shifts in AI Development

The field changes so rapidly that I hadn't imagined last year we'd get this far with reinforcement learning and test time compute, which seems limitless. Pre-training worked, post-training techniques on top were fantastic, and now inference time compute has added massive scaling law potential.

I'm interested in whether there's some new algorithmic breakthrough ahead, because this entire regime could be changed by one person who discovers a more efficient approach. You have to remain open-minded that the last big algorithmic breakthrough hasn't been found yet.

The next step is what comes after pre-training to reinforcement learning—the end-to-end training loop that I think will emerge in the next year. This could represent another scaling law breakthrough as labs work on more integrated response reasoning models.

## Building the Next Generation of AI Applications

Looking ahead, I see three critical systems that need to be built as first-class components around models to create sophisticated applications:

1. **Memory systems** - For maintaining context and learning
2. **Tools usage** - For interacting with external systems and data
3. **Entitlements** - Access control for what actions can be taken

This scaffolding layer—model plus these three systems—enables true agents. An agent has an ID, management and provision control, and defined capabilities. This is how we'll build the application layer of the future.

## The Future of Software Development

There's an interesting question about whether users will prefer to generate software just-in-time instead of using packaged software. While this is possible, I believe both approaches will coexist. Great applications provide excellent canvases for interaction with AI models, creating feedback loops between the interface and the model.

Think of Excel as an IDE—a great canvas where you can bring the best analyst model and create a loop between the canvas and the model. You can generate applications just-in-time, or have pre-built applications that facilitate the feedback loop to the model.

The role of software engineering will evolve but persist. If a Martian observed humans in the 1980s, they'd see offices with typing pools and slide pools. Returning today, they'd observe that all eight billion people have become "typists." Similarly, all of us will be creating software, but there will still be a job called software engineer—it will just be different.

Software engineers are becoming software architects. The metacognition aspect remains crucial: while AI code generation is fantastic until it does something unexpected, I need the meta-model of my repository and exactly what happened. My favorite GitHub feature now is reviewing complete change logs of all agents working on my repository.

This resembles a good development manager's job—ensuring builds don't break and code maintains quality. There will be an abstraction level uplift even in a world of AI agents because legal liability, until laws change, remains with humans and institutions humans build. As long as that's true, we need humans in the loop at a fundamental level, requiring tools for humans to understand what these systems are doing.

## What's Overhyped vs. Underhyped in AI

We're certainly not short of overhyping. Everything is "AI all the time," which is fine—we live and die by our ability to get into a frenzy about something new. As Steve Jobs or Bob Dylan said, you're either busy being born or busy dying. It's better to be busy being born.

What we need to work on as a tech community is earning social permission. One demo that completely blew me away was in early 2023 in India, where a local developer daisy-chained GPT-3.5 with India stack speech-to-text and text-to-speech open-source tools. They showed a local Indian farmer using a WhatsApp chatbot to get agricultural subsidies from a government website.

How something built on the west coast of the United States reached a real use case that fast through diffusion and global accessibility—that's the underhyped story that needs telling at scale. The overhyped story is model capability, which is fantastic, but if we can't get the world to recognize that this makes a real difference in people's lives everywhere, we're in trouble.

A World Bank study in Nigeria (now extended to Peru or Chile) found that access to something like Copilot is probably the best tech intervention in education in Africa or Latin America. This has been our dream in tech for decades, and it's within our grasp.

## Microsoft Copilot: The New Computer Interface

Even on existing form factors—a computer with mouse and keyboard—we're seeing transformative changes. Since 1995, when Bill Gates built Microsoft's first speech research group, we've wondered when speech would become first-class on PCs.

With Copilot, there's both vision and speech capability. I leave it on all the time—it can see what I see and I can speak to it. This feels like a "precision mouse movement" moment for computing. Even on existing hardware, we can completely change computer use, and new form factors will emerge too.

Computer use is fascinating because you have intelligence plus access to all your data—personal, work, office documents. The dream from the movie "Her"—where the operating system embeds itself as your most trusted agent—is the direction we're heading. Can these agents become your computers and perform computer use for you?

The most operative consideration is trust. Can I trust this system to delegate what I want? That requires precision, privacy, and numerous other considerations that will need to work out over time.

## Privacy, Security, and Sovereignty

When building any product or system, you need to address three critical boundaries:

- **Privacy** - Every user cares about this
- **Security** - Every tenant or customer will care about this on top of privacy  
- **Sovereignty** - Every country will care about this along with security and privacy

Any AI system must answer questions for people, organizations, and countries about how it crosses all three boundaries.

## Quantum Computing and AI Integration

We've been investing in quantum computing for over 20 years—I'm the third Microsoft CEO writing checks for quantum research. Our focus has always been building a general-purpose quantum computer through stable, error-corrected qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

We bet on a physical property envisioned by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana. After achieving a physics breakthrough and fabricating that particle, we've created our quantum chip. If you want to understand the language of nature through simulation, a quantum computer is ideal because physics and nature are quantum.

I think of AI as an emulator of that simulator. We're seeing good advances using HPC plus AI to accelerate progress in chemistry, physics, and material science. Quantum would be the next step, and we're excited about what AI plus quantum and HPC in a loop can accomplish.

## Leadership Principles for the AI Era

Throughout my journey from engineer to CEO, I've learned that you don't start with a specific end goal, but you do start with high ambition for what you want to accomplish. I wasn't waiting to become CEO to do my best work—my first job felt like the greatest job I could ever have when I joined in 1992.

Don't wait for the next big thing. Take what you have as the biggest thing and make it expansive. Big things are achieved by having a team around you. Learn to work in teams and make teams great. The difference between school and work is joining a team and figuring out how to make it successful.

Everyone thinks someone else's job is to align the team—it's actually your job to align the team. High ambition for your own impact plus knowing how to work in and make teams effective is magical.

I look for three qualities in people:

1. **Bringing clarity** - Good architects bring clarity; bad architects bring confusion, even if equally smart. In ambiguous, uncertain situations, people who can determine what to do next are at a premium.

2. **Creating energy** - Not just bringing energy, but bringing multiple constituents together. Leaders who say "my team is great, everyone else sucks" aren't useful. I need people who can bring people together across the company and outside it.

3. **Solving over-constrained problems** - My favorite interview question asks someone to describe a project that was going nowhere until they figured out a path. Successful people take over-constrained problems and figure out how to unconstrain them.

Leadership isn't something you do later in life—you do it every step of the way.

## The Tools That Empower

If I were starting over at 22 today, I'd think about the history of how Office got built—word processor, spreadsheet, slide tool. These tools give you an incredible sense of empowerment, analytical power, number sense. A spreadsheet is unbelievable scaffolding—columns and rows with a Turing machine in the middle.

When I see Copilot today with researcher, analyst, and creator capabilities, that's like the Word, Excel, PowerPoint of this era. Every day I go to these tools for that sense of empowerment.

What are the tools we can put in people's hands that will give them that sense of empowerment? That's what I would love to work on. The people who make those tools are likely sitting in audiences like this right now.
