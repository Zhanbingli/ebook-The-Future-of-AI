## Opening: The Current Design Moment

Designers need to be founders. We need folks who are designers to step into the founder role and start companies. It feels intuitively like we're in the MS-DOS era of AI right now. If you look back 10 years from now, everyone's going to say, "Can you believe we just had this chat box?"

**Interviewer:** Let me welcome Dylan. I'm curious about the makeup of the audience here. How many people have used Figma before?

*[Overwhelming show of hands]*

**Interviewer:** How many people consider themselves to be designers?

*[Many hands raised]*

**Interviewer:** And how many are currently founders?

*[Good number of hands]*

**Interviewer:** That's a good mix. We'll hear the Figma story, then talk about advice around AI and design, and get some founder advice from Dylan too. Maybe start by giving us a snapshot of where Figma is today, then we can go back to the beginning.

**Dylan:** Today we are in many different places. We're hybrid, 1,700 people now—which is wild. I have to pinch myself at that number. We have eight products now. We just doubled our product lineup at our last Config conference. Very excited to hear feedback if you have any on things like Figma Make, Sites, Draw, Buzz. It's been a very exciting time, with lots of work as we explore everything we can do to help our audience.

## The Origin Story: From Drones to WebGL

**Interviewer:** Take us back to maybe 19-year-old Dylan getting started with the kernel of the idea that eventually became Figma. It wasn't a straight line getting there.

**Dylan:** In the early days—well, before it was even Figma—Evan and I were at Brown together. He was my TA, and we were asking ourselves: "Why now? What's changing in the world?" The two answers we came up with that we felt deep conviction about were drones and quadcopters, and WebGL.

Evan, after about a month, said, "Hey, not into drones for various reasons." That was the one I was pushing for more at the time, aside from WebGL. I was like, "Great, WebGL it is."

WebGL—everyone probably knows—is a way to use the GPU in your computer through the browser. Web GPU is its successor. We started going deep on what we could build, and two main paths emerged: games or tools. Pretty quickly we said, "Not games, let's go tools."

Then it was deep exploration with many twists and turns as we explored all sorts of tools we could build. We really started in earnest in August 2012, whereas we'd started talking about it in December 2011. It took a while to get to the point where we started, and then from there, I'd say it was at least June or July 2013 before we went all-in on "Let's build Figma as it is today." Even then, there was still a narrowing path to get to the product that exists now.

**Interviewer:** When you first started, were you thinking about this as a startup and company you wanted to build, or more as a project you wanted to do with your friend?

**Dylan:** No, it was definitely the hope of a startup—a startup that could scale. My downside case was getting to work with Evan, who I considered then and consider now to be a hero. He's the smartest guy I know. If you have any doubt about this statement, just look up his GitHub. He's an amazing man and an absolute genius.

I figured worst-case scenario, I spend a few years working with Evan, learn a lot, then go back to school—same place I'm at now, can't hurt. Upside case, we build a cool company. All the problems we were thinking about working on were very interesting to me, so I didn't really see any risk to the scenario.

It also helped that I had the Thiel Fellowship. I would have done it without it, but having $100K over two years—I know now with inflation it probably sounds like less than it was then—but having actual cash and not having to dig into savings or go into debt was huge. Not just because of the cash element, but because it gives you time. If we had stopped six months in at our decision point, Figma would not be here today. If you're a founder or thinking about founding, you've got to give yourself time somehow. That's really important.

## The Pivot Hell Period

**Interviewer:** You spent a couple years trying to do all the twists and turns before the thing that eventually became Figma. What kept you going? A lot of times founders get into pivot hell, jumping from idea to idea, and motivation keeps declining. How did you keep yourselves motivated and feel like you were on the right track?

**Dylan:** First of all, just working with Evan was super fun. We were thinking through ideas by building them. It felt like every week we were inventing the future in some way.

At some point, I thought, "Memes are going to go to the moon," and I convinced Evan, "Hey, let's build a meme generator." This was 2012. We built a great meme generator—I think it would have been the best one in the market. My thesis was right, by the way. Look at the exponential curve of memes since 2012. We would have made some money there.

At the same time, after a week of that, I think both of us were ready to quit. I was asking myself, "Why'd I drop out of Brown for this?" That was probably a pretty low point at the start.

But other than that, there's the constant existential nature of asking yourself, "What are we doing? What's the big goal here?" when you're in that phase of really trying to discover what to work on. If you've got a co-founder, a collaborator, you're not alone. Hopefully your highs and their highs, your lows and their highs cancel out somehow, and you can feed off each other to keep going. That really helps.

## Getting the First Users

**Interviewer:** Once you came up with the idea for Figma, how did you get your first users?

**Dylan:** Really the first users of Figma came a lot from cold emailing and people in my network—folks I had interned with at Flipboard, LinkedIn, O'Reilly Media. From that, there were people I could reach out to who could tell me others to talk with.

But I also just looked online: "Who are the designers I think could be really helpful to us and whose work I respect?" If they answer my email and let me buy them a coffee, it'll be like a personal moment for me because they're my hero. And a lot of them replied. It's kind of wild that people reply to cold emails, but they do.

Then it turns out designers give great feedback. It wasn't just meeting them and them saying, "Yeah, your product sucks." They'd say, "Here's exactly why it's not great, here's what you can do better, here's what it would take for me to use this." The more I engaged and we worked through that, the better the product got. I'd follow up with them, and eventually they started converting. Some took a while, but many converted later on.

We kind of went on tour. At this point we had venture investment—the venture firms that invested in us had invested in other companies too. I had them make introductions to companies. For an entire summer, I basically met with five, six, seven companies a week at least, sometimes several a day, saying, "Hey, here's a demo. Will you use it? If not, why not?"

Very low conversion rate. In that entire summer, maybe two of them went for it and actually started using Figma. One was Notion, the other was the company that became Coda, then called Krypton. Kind of interesting—they're both cloud-based document tools with very similar philosophies to us. But then you launch and people start using it more. There are a lot of folks out there that resonate with the message. It was a slow arc over time, but the constant was feedback—getting feedback to the team, making sure we understood what problems we needed to solve.

## Launch Strategy and Timing

**Interviewer:** Everyone tells you to launch early, and the reason is to get feedback. From the outside it looks like you took a long time to launch, but behind the scenes you were talking to tons of users and potential customers constantly. How did you think about when was the right time to actually launch?

**Dylan:** First of all, I definitely echo the point of launch as soon as you can. If you take anything away from this, it's don't do what I did. Get your product out faster and charge money faster for the product to see if you actually can make money—unless you have some genius galaxy-brain consumer thing you're doing, in which case figure it out yourself.

The feedback is essential, and you should launch as quickly as you can. For me, the feedback was very clear: it's not ready. That made it so we didn't feel comfortable launching yet. But looking back, we did have the capital. I should have scaled the team faster so we could move faster and get it out quicker. That was something I've learned looking back.

When a team at Figma comes to me with an epic roadmap that they think is perfection, the first question I always ask is: "How do we slim that down? How do we make it more bite-sized and test this earlier with our users?" I try to push people internally toward a one-month or three-month cadence at most. If someone comes to me with a 9-month, 12-month, two-year cadence, it's like, "What the hell are you doing?"

**Interviewer:** That's such an important point, especially for small teams. A lot of times people think, "I have all this stuff to build, so I need to hire a bunch of people." But usually the right answer is: "How can you scope it down and do fewer things really well?" Is that part of your culture?

**Dylan:** Constraints can actually really help. But I also think the startup cycle you're always in is something like: if you're the leader of a startup, you need to be identifying what you're doing the most of, figuring out how to get someone else to help you with that—or maybe in the future it's AI, who knows? But then from there, how do you find that person? And if you don't have enough resources, how do you get the resources? That's a cycle you're always in. It just turns out that having constraints breeds creativity and interesting ways to solve problems. I think they're useful.

## The Inflection Point

**Interviewer:** What was the inflection point? When did you actually believe this was going to be a huge company?

**Dylan:** I think the point at which I started to believe this might be real was way later than our users did. People were telling me, "This is amazing. I'm really excited. Here's my 12-page doc on all the things I want you to do for Figma." I should have known then, even though our product was really bad, that there was something there.

But in reality, it took until Microsoft told us, "Hey, this is spreading like wildfire, and we're asking ourselves: should we shut it down or should we keep going? The reason we're asking ourselves that is because you're not charging us. Maybe you should actually charge for the product."

That was the moment I was like, "Oh, I think something might be working. We should probably charge people." That was like five years in. So yeah, don't do that.

Also listen for when people are pulling the product out of you. Everyone talks about product-market fit, but product-market pull is really important. You'll see signs of it when people are highly engaged, when they're obsessive about what you're doing, when they see the future of the vision you're planting. That's a sign you should really double down in whatever way you can.

So many people interpret it instead as, "Oh man, if only we had all these things they're asking for, then we might have product-market fit. Guess we've got to grind for a long time and who knows if it'll work." The right mindset is, "Oh my god, they actually care enough to give us this feedback. This is huge." I think people misinterpret that too much.

## Dealing with Rejection and Feedback

**Interviewer:** A lot of people are nervous to seek feedback because they don't want to hear that it's not good enough, that the thing they poured time and energy into is not good yet and they wouldn't use or pay for it. How did you shift your perspective to actually want to seek that?

**Dylan:** I think maybe it's just childhood for me. When I was growing up, I was a child actor—not like a child actor that got into anything really cool that you know about, but commercials and some TV. As part of that, you audition constantly, and you constantly get rejected. For me that was not a big deal. I was used to rejection and had fun with the process.

If you're not there yet, seek rejection—it's got interesting data in it. Don't you want to know the data?

## The Current Design Renaissance

**Interviewer:** Let's switch gears and talk about design. It's been a really great month for design. We've had popular redesigns from Airbnb and Netflix, Apple's new liquid glass UI—which seems somewhat controversial—you guys had incredible launches at Config recently. At YC we have a call for more design founders, and then maybe the most surprising thing was OpenAI acquiring Johnny Ive's company for more than $6 billion. Why now? What's happening where design is really part of the conversation in the tech world?

**Dylan:** In some ways it's new, in some ways it's not. Design has been growing in importance exponentially over the past decade. At Figma we see it up close every day—more designers being hired, design going from "lipstick on a pig, make it pretty at the end" to "let's deeply think about how it works every step along the way." That's been an ongoing mindset shift.

But now, in this age of AI, if you really believe that development gets easier, it's simpler to create software, faster to create software, then what is your differentiator? It's design, it's craft, it's attention to detail, it's point of view. What we're seeing is recognition of that. Airbnb literally said their differentiator is design.

There are lots of takes on OpenAI and this more-than-$6-billion transaction. Some people think it's the stupidest thing in the world, others are hailing it as absolute genius. My mental model is there are some people who, when they do something you don't understand, it's easy to go into attack mode and dismiss it. But over enough time, sometimes you see patterns and you're like, "Okay, I've consistently not understood what this person's saying over the course of years." Years later, I go back and what I said in response to what they did was just wrong.

Then you do this mental flip: assume there's something to learn from whatever they're doing, assume you're missing something. I look at something like OpenAI—some parts I understand (design is a differentiator), some parts I don't understand (that's a really big transaction). But Sam is one of those people who's right about a lot of stuff. I'd encourage you, if you just dismissed it outright, to ask yourself what you might be missing.

## New AI-Focused Products

**Interviewer:** You launched some really cool AI-focused products at Config about a month ago, with really positive reception from users and the design community. Can you share more about those and your motivation for building them?

**Dylan:** If you look historically at the products we've launched for Figma, the pattern is: we notice behavior happening in Figma Design, we take it out of Figma Design and make it its own product. Therefore, Figma Design can be what it wants to be—a product design tool.

Whether it's FigJam as a whiteboarding brainstorming tool—the first new product we launched that we could make a dedicated space for—or Slides, where we saw 5% of files created in Figma Design were slides. Great, pull that out, make a slide tool. Because there's all the stuff you need for slides that, if you put it in Figma Design, now you've got a complicated UI where one plus one doesn't equal three, it's more equal to 1.5.

A lot of the things you saw launch at Config are in that category. Draw, for example, which is a way to do more vector tasks—we made a separate mode so users can go deeper. Because if you believe craft is the differentiator, more people want to be more expressive. How do we enable our customers and designers everywhere to do that on the Figma platform?

Buzz—same thing. You have all these people who want to create mass exports and figure out ways to create production graphics. If you've got a brand team that's created templates, how do you make it so you can empower a marketing team to use those templates and do mass creation of assets? That's a core workflow we see all the time, but we didn't want to make Figma Design more complicated or dumb it down. So instead, you make a new surface.

Sites—we see people designing websites all the time in Figma Design, but they have to go somewhere else to actually build the site and get it out there. How do we get that so they can actually ship it?

And Make—we're so excited about Make. This is a tool that lets you go from prompt to app. It's already changed a lot of how we do work at Figma in terms of quickly prototyping and being able to get to the point where you throw ideas away faster. With Figma Make, there's so much more we want to explore and are really excited to explore. Stay tuned on that one.

## The Blurring Lines: Design and Development

**Interviewer:** It feels like the line between design and development is getting blurred. They used to be very distinct phases, and now they're almost being combined. How do you think about that with the tools you're making, and how has that changed your own development process within Figma?

**Dylan:** I'll start with Figma. For us, it's all about speed of iteration, speed of testing ideas, and tools like Make really help with that. It helps to have ways to rapidly prototype and figure out what's going to work and what's not, and make that as low-cost as possible. Then there are tools I can't talk about and things we're developing that have been pretty instrumental to how our development process is changing. Can't wait to talk about them with you, but not today sadly.

When you go back to how design and development are blurring more, there's a lot going on there. Product is also blurring with design and development, and potentially even parts of research. This is all becoming less distinct and coming together more. This was happening before AI, but it's happening even more with AI. There's something about AI that empowers generalist behavior.

I will say that the models today are better at the earlier phases of development than they are at late-stage codebases. If you have an established codebase, I think you're going to get less out of AI development tools as they currently exist than if you're at the very start. Everything's better suited for prototyping and zero-to-one than it is from one-to-100 at this current moment. But in a week, this could change.

## The Future of User Interfaces

**Interviewer:** How do you expect user interfaces to change over the next couple years? Chat has become a lot of the dominant interface paradigm, but it feels like there's got to be something better that comes along, right?

**Dylan:** It feels intuitively like we're in the MS-DOS era of AI right now. If you look back 10 years from now, everyone's going to go, "Can you believe we just had this chat box?"

Yet I think the problem of how you show users all the things that are possible to do with these models is a very hard challenge. There's something about the experiments that have worked that's very interesting. For example, look at Midjourney—they started off in Discord where you can rapidly see all the other things people are doing, and that was in many ways a way to show people what's possible. Or even Meta's new AI app—there's been a lot of press about the public aspect of people accidentally sharing things that are quite private. But the flip side is you actually learn what you can do, and I think that's been underexplored in the media.

There's this problem that people have not solved of how you expose capabilities of these models, and there's so much that needs to be developed and worked through there. There's a lot to come.

On top of that, everything will be more contextual—AI as you blend it into different applications. That's a really interesting layer to think about. And we're going to have so many new surfaces as well. The surfaces that will exist are not going to be just your phone, laptop, and tablet. It's going to be glasses, we're going to see much more in terms of different types of displays that exist throughout your life. So the surfaces are going to multiply, AI will have context, all of it will be a layer you have to intersperse. That's a really interesting challenge for design—how do you reconcile all that, keep it consistent, and actually be able to navigate that whole broad spectrum that people expect you to show up on?

## Design's Role in AI Research

**Interviewer:** How many of you consider yourselves researchers or have done research work? *[Many hands raised]* I know you've done this internally at Figma, building your own models. What is the role of design in research and the research work you've done? What are some design decisions that go into making them better and work really well?

**Dylan:** I think a lot of researchers are trained in an academic environment and come at problems as abstractions. They try to think very generally. If you're doing pure math research, keep going—that is definitely the way to approach it. If you're doing more applied research, for example in AI, I really think that thinking like a designer can be helpful and working with designers can be helpful.

We found, for example, that embedding designers into our research teams—because obviously we're doing a lot of work on how to make better AI tools for designers—has been critical. Researchers need that intuition of how designers think, and without actually having that close collaboration, it really doesn't work.

Now you might say, "Yeah, that's nice, but you're building for designers." My response would be that designers have this mindset of building for an audience—maybe it's a general audience, maybe it's a specific audience. That audience has a problem or set of problems they're trying to solve. That sort of thinking is very useful to bring into the research context.

Also, qualitative research needs to pair with more deep AI research. The more you can actually surface through qualitative methods what people are actually trying to do and how they perceive and think, the more you can advance. My push for anyone coming from more of a research background would be: go get in the field, go talk to people. You'll learn from it and it'll make you go faster. Some of the ways designers have learned and tools designers have are likely useful for you.

## The Evolving Role of Designers

**Interviewer:** It feels like the role of designer is shifting a lot. Design and development are drawing closer together, there's research where design can be involved. How do you think that role changes over the next decade?

**Dylan:** I'm really excited about how this will evolve. I think designers will have far more leverage in the future, and the value of design will only continue to go up. Your RFP—request for proposal—for designer founders embodied this. You said designers need to be founders. We need folks who are designers to step into the founder role and start companies.

Looking back, you have Brian Chesky, you have Karri at Linear. We have so many designer founders you can point to now and say these folks are really successful and killing it. But I think the number of designer founders will multiply. The number of designers who are leading large areas and sort of GMs will grow as well.

In general, designers will be looked to as experts inside companies in sort of the same way you might have a writer today who is the expert and best writer in the company, but everyone has a word processor and can write. You'll have a designer who might be the best at problem-solving and thinking through how to actually craft a solution and explore the idea maze, figure out which direction to go, create a system around it. But I think most everyone in the company will be contributing to that process of design. So there will be a lot of curation involved and a lot of leadership will be needed from designers. They have to step up.

## Internal AI Usage at Figma

**Interviewer:** What are some of the most interesting ways you're using AI internally at Figma?

**Dylan:** Can't talk about it all since some of it is products we'll be releasing. But maybe one thing I'll say is on the designer-embedded-in-research side—it's been fascinating to see just how important it is for designers to contribute on evals.

If you think about it, as you're developing a model or developing research ideas, you have to have good evals. Usually the researchers are the ones building those, and I think that's kind of the wrong model, for us at least. Designers, my point of view, should be contributing to evals. Product people should be contributing to evals. It's not something you need your engineers and researchers to do because they probably have less understanding of the end user, less contact with the end user, than your designers and product people do.

As you design these models, eval has become more important too.

## Skills for the AI Era

**Interviewer:** If you were in your 20s today, what are some skills or tools you would focus on becoming great at to be successful in this new AI world?

**Dylan:** The setup of the question is that you should do different things than you did in the past. That's probably true. But I'd start by saying that the stuff folks have done historically to get really good at thinking and work through problems with critical thought, and learn broadly so they can make mental connections—those are still important.

I think learning about as many different areas as you're curious about deeply, and trying to experience the world, making sure you're still relating to people—those are pretty core things you should still do.

One thing I'm worried about: I think a lot of people in their 20s these days, apparently according to the stats, are dating less. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not—y'all can tell me later. But if you think about the future, it'd be so easy to just go talk to your AI model all day. Maybe that gives you a sense of social connection. I would highly advise you don't do that. I would highly advise that y'all date if you're in that cohort.

I even go so far as to say—this is less a comment about the products in this category of the past, but more about what the future could hold—I think AI boyfriends and girlfriends, if developed and allowed to exist, is a societal self-own. I think it's actively poisonous to society if this becomes a primary mode of relationship. There are a lot of things we need to talk about there and have a pretty broad society-level discussion about.

## The Most Fun Period at Figma

**Interviewer:** Before we open up to questions, what was the most fun period in the history of building Figma for you?

**Dylan:** The answer everyone's expecting, but it's true—it's right now. We have so many things we can do, the most brilliant people around to do them with. I love my team. I love the problem set we have. Some companies go forward and kind of tap out and don't have any more ideas. The number of ideas we have right now has grown so much. There's so much we can do and so much people are asking of us. It's more about how do we make sure we do the right things? That's a fascinating and really fun place to be.

## Q&A Session

**Question:** I'm a solo founder, product engineer, everything solo entrepreneur, and recently I've started using Cursor to handle both coding and design, even down to pixel-level details. What do you think about Cursor? Can Cursor become one of your competitors? And I recently discovered tools like Penpot giving developers more control through open-source, self-hosted options. What do you think Figma should move toward being more open and developer-friendly to catch up with the trend of more solo engineers becoming product engineers?

**Dylan:** When it comes to AI generation, if you take a step forward from "okay, I generated something," the next question is "okay, how to make it good?" There are different ways to do that. You can be writing code and going into your browser and having that loop—that's a very structural way to think. Other people prefer to think in a more free-form way.

With Make, we're trying to enable that in a way that's visual-first rather than code-first. You can still get to the code. But I really don't think of Cursor as a competitor. We just launched our MCP server to explicitly make it so you can get your designs into Cursor and Windsurf and all these other VS Code tools faster. I think there are just going to be new workflows established.

Like I said, if the differentiator is design, then your first generation, your one-shot is probably not the thing that's going to win. So I'd encourage you to think a little bit further than that.

In terms of open source, we actually just announced today the acquisition of Payload CMS, which is an open-source project, and I'm really excited about what we can do there and how we can support open source more.

**Question:** I'm a game designer at a startup in San Francisco. I graduated last year from USC in computer science and game design—best major ever. It's cool to hear about the games roots of Figma. I have kind of a more personal question for you: what is the meaning of life?

**Dylan:** I think seek out how to explore consciousness, learn as much as you can, share love with others, and make sure that you feel fulfilled and the other people around you are fulfilled and happy at the end of the day. That can be something you do on a micro level in your local community, a macro level at scale—doesn't matter. As long as you're living true to your internal values, I think you're leading a fulfilling life.

**Question:** As a designer, are there any specific design principles that you love and use which you think a lot of builders or companies get wrong or sometimes completely ignore?

**Dylan:** The biggest one I repeat all the time at Figma, which is not my own—it's existed for decades—is "keep the simple things simple and make the complex things possible."

There's always a wide range of things you want to be able to enable. But if you try to do all of them at the expense of your product not being approachable and not being obvious or intuitive how to use, you're kind of messing up. You have to figure out how to do both, but you start with making the simple things simple.

**Question:** I study HCI and computer science at Columbia. Say there's a founder you really respect and you finally landed an enterprise contract and have decent traction on the project you've been building with friends. What would be the most polite way to show them the product and ask them to be an angel investor?

**Dylan:** I would send them a Loom over email, so that way it's got an async component since time is sometimes hard to find. They can watch it. If you want to really pique their interest, mutual connections help. But like I said earlier, cold emails work too. Don't expect a cold email, but they work.

**Question:** You said you noticed behaviors when deciding what to productize. I can clearly see that—I was using slides for classes before you dropped Slides, using lock layers for social media graphics before Buzz made that easier. How do you watch how people repurpose tools and what kind of structure do you use for these emerging use cases?

**Dylan:** It's always a mix of signals. You have to do everything from watching support requests to qualitative interviews, sitting with people and watching how they work, looking at the data and doing data science analysis on it, looking at what people are saying on social media and more. But you digest all those signals and build some intuition around it and hypotheses you can test. It's kind of art plus science, but you have to combine a lot of methods.

**Question:** Right now you're helping designers in a huge breadth of industries. When you just started with the cold emailing, how did you go about defining your ICP? Was it very broad as today or did you start focused on one industry?

**Dylan:** We really started focused on product design for digital products, and even more narrowly where people cared about design. If I'm being totally honest, rather than the broad world, it seemed like it'd be an easier sell. But I think it required a lot of slimming down of our ambition to be able to state that clearly. I started off saying we're going to do everything, and thankfully the team pushed back. So it got us to here with the ambition of later doing everything, but I'm glad we started more narrowly.

**Question:** My background is CS major and also traditional art, where AI is not necessarily as popular at the moment. How is Figma navigating ethical challenges of AI and design and incorporating AI into your products?

**Dylan:** There are so many different ethical challenges you could consider—everything from "okay, you're doing some inference, is it heating up the planet?" to "are these models regurgitating something they've seen elsewhere?" and beyond. You have to be very clear about what you're trying to solve for.

Maybe a sort of escape answer: right now a lot of the work we're doing is actually with third-party models, so that's something we have less control over. As we do more things in-house, I think these questions are very relevant and things we'll have to wrestle with like the art world has.

**Question:** I'm an HCI researcher and design founder. As we've been thinking about interfaces and how we talk to AI, it seems we tend to anthropomorphize things. These are probabilistic and we can't design explicitly how we did with previous hardware. Do you think of AI-human interaction as necessarily a tool, or how do you build a mental model around this?

**Dylan:** There's sort of where things are at now, where they're going, and you have to consider both. There's an interesting split maybe between people that come from a materialist worldview—and by that I don't mean they're going and buying stuff all the time, I mean the worldview of materialism is one of consciousness arises from matter—and then on the opposite side of the spectrum are religious mindsets where people go, "Of course that's wrong, there's God, everyone has a soul" versus "doesn't have a soul, obviously it's like a computer."

Those are fundamentally at odds, and my prediction is that we'll probably see an increase in people projecting consciousness onto AI, whether or not that's the right thing you agree with or don't agree with. I think the number of people that'll do that will increase. It leads to some very hard-to-wrestle-with territories.

In terms of what that means for HCI or whatever you want to call it, that's a very underexplored question and I'm excited to see what you do with it.

**Interviewer:** I think we're at time sadly, but I just want to thank everybody for coming and wish you all the best of luck with whatever path you pursue. Thank you, Dylan.

**Dylan:** Thank you.
