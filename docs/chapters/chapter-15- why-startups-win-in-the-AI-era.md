## The Déjà Vu of Technological Transformation

Aaron and I go way back. I searched through my old Bump emails—Bump was my startup—for "Aaron@box.net" and found exchanges where we would coordinate meetups in Mountain View with three founders: Aaron, me, and a guy named Sam Altman. We'd plan brunch or lunch, and then there'd be follow-up emails saying, "Well, Sam's probably going to not show up again."

You started Box before many people in this audience were alive. Who here is below 20 years old? [Show of hands] Wow. Great. Then that's very accurate.

We're going to talk about AI extensively, but let's start with another major transformation you navigated: the shift to cloud computing. Walk us through what that looked like at a high level, and then maybe what's different or similar about the transition to AI.

We started the company in 2005, and you have to literally go back 20 years and think about a world where the internet was much slower, browsers were way worse. We didn't have the iPhone. We didn't have Android. Chrome didn't exist. Everything was just worse on every dimension.

We basically had an initial idea that as the internet got faster and as you worked on more mobile devices, you'd want to be able to access your data from anywhere. That was the original idea of Box—going between different computers, accessing your files, sharing them, collaborating.

So we launched the company. It was initially focused on the consumer market, or consumer slash prosumer—anybody that wanted to sign up. We started to get a little bit of traction, and by "a little bit," I mean we're talking like 10 people signed up in the first week or something. It was very slow and steady growth.

We got a little more growth, some early funding from Mark Cuban and angel investors. We dropped out of college. We got more of an upswing with a freemium business model—let people sign up for free and start using the product.

Then one day we ran into this fork in the road: do we stay on the consumer path or pivot to the enterprise? The calculus was we felt it would be too hard to compete with all the consumer technology platforms that would give away storage for free. They'd embed it into their operating system or social network. So we decided to pivot to the enterprise where we could be cheaper, faster, and easier than the big incumbents.

We got extremely lucky on timing because we rode this growth wave of mobile and cloud working in tandem to create a new IT architecture within enterprises. As companies moved to the cloud, they needed a way to share their data and access their information, and we became an increasingly obvious choice.

## The Crucial Difference: AI's Head Start

There are similarities between the early days of cloud and AI, with maybe one big difference. In the early days of cloud, we were having to convince people that the cloud would be this big deal. We had to tell everybody the future was going to be cloud computing, that it was safe to trust us with your data. A lot of people didn't believe us, which meant we couldn't win deals in entire customer segments.

Conversely, with AI, you're no longer really having to convince people that AI is the future. Everybody tends to be bought in, at least in the enterprise segment. There's still slowness in adoption at large enterprises, but it's not because people aren't convinced AI is the future—it's just because there's a natural pace of change enterprises have to go through.

**Why are they convinced? Is it just that they've personally used ChatGPT?**

Unlike cloud, AI didn't emerge overnight as this new concept. We've had science fiction for probably 100 years saying you're going to have robots and artificial intelligence. Over the past 20-30 years, it's been in the zeitgeist—self-driving cars, watching Watson on Jeopardy, using early products like Siri and Alexa.

It's been pervasive that at some point AI would get good enough to be this helpful aid. Now you have the ChatGPT moment where the head of marketing can play with ChatGPT and think, "Wow, this seems to write marketing copy maybe better than even my own marketing people."

You don't need to sell them anymore that AI is the future. It's about how to implement something safe, reliable, that works with your data and that you can trust.

## Unlocking Unstructured Data's Hidden Value

So Box started as basically a folder in the cloud, then you added more functionality. But AI seems able to completely change what you can do. Help us understand what those cool new capabilities are for big companies.

For us, the exciting thing is that AI agents thrive on unstructured data. There are basically two data types that matter in the world:

**Structured data** goes into databases. When you launch an app, you start with a database for customer names, IDs, user IDs. In big companies, it's invoice numbers, client records, revenue amounts, distribution partner names.

Then there's **unstructured data**—all their documents, contracts, invoices, marketing assets, presentations. The vast majority of enterprise data is this content. It's called unstructured because it can be totally free-form text with no inherent computer structure.

The problem is that historically, you've never been able to automate anything with all the data going into something like Box. Two years ago, you couldn't ask your files a question. You could query a database—"find me all records above this value"—but you couldn't do that with files because computers didn't know how to read and understand those documents.

AI agents change this completely. All of a sudden, all the data inside those folders becomes immensely valuable because now you can ask that data questions and begin to automate workflows around it.

Our vision is: what if you turned all this information into a new corporate asset or set of knowledge that companies can operate from? That's where I think there's immense startup opportunity—a world of AI agents for almost every task or job function in the enterprise.

## The Augmentation Argument: More Work, Not Less Jobs

A lot of people worry that if AI agents do a bunch of jobs, we don't need the humans anymore. I know you have a strong perspective that it will go the exact other way. Tell us why.

If you go to most companies and assess how valuable is all the work being done—every email sent, time spent finding information, manual work reading documents and extracting information versus time on truly high-impact stuff like being with customers, product breakthroughs, customer support—the vast majority of time inside a company is on stuff that's necessary but not strategic.

When you think about that ratio, if you could free up a company to work on strategic stuff instead of basically unstrategic stuff that doesn't differentiate them, most companies actually have a large set of things they'd do with their time. They'd spend more time on breakthrough innovation, more time with customers, launch more marketing campaigns, proactively support customers instead of being reactive.

The press gets this wrong because they're not inside big companies seeing how much time we spend on useless activities that are necessary but not strategic. When I talk to companies and say, "What if AI agents did all this work?" their eyes light up because they realize they can free up time to do much more interesting things.

There's also this entire category of work where, doing pure microeconomics, I could pay for the labor if I knew it would produce enough value—but the threshold for starting that work is too high. I can never even try to see if it's useful.

I would argue that in 10 years, the vast majority of work that gets done will be work that today is in that category—work we can't attack because we're not going to hire somebody for $120,000 a year just to see if it produces value.

## The New Economics of AI-Driven Business Models

When you create these new capabilities, many don't look like traditional software where you sell seat licenses to humans who click buttons. How will business models need to change?

Prior to this year, if you were building a SaaS company, your only monetization strategy was: how many humans need licenses to my software? You were maxed out by the demographic size of that category. If I sold software for lawyers, I could only sell as many licenses as that company had lawyers—a huge limiter to addressable market size.

Agents completely blow that up. You can go to a company and say, "I know you only have three lawyers, but my agents could do the work of unlimited lawyers." You're no longer selling based on the number of humans; you're selling based on the volume of work that needs to get done.

Take legal contract review. Previously, a human would cost $5-10 per contract based on human time. AI agents can do this for 10 cents. So you charge the customer $2—they save 80%, and you extract meaningful profit. There's no particular limiter to how much they'll pay; it's just how many contracts they have.

Every space will have a slightly different version of this consumption-based business model. You generally want some subscription fee for recurring revenue rather than only being paid when work happens, but you'll see more consumption orientation with AI.

## The Deflationary Advantage

**You think the prices AI companies charge per unit of work will be a fraction of human cost rather than traditional software cost. If it costs 10 cents, are people really willing to pay $2 for something they know costs 10?**

The question is how much software you build on top of the AI tokens. There's a continuum—if there's almost no software, you'll get price-compressed down to 2x the token cost. But with tremendous amounts of software, you could probably support 80-90% gross margins.

Eventually, customers won't just be paying for intelligence tokens—they'll be paying for workflow software on top of the tokens, for AI agents with unique context, connections, capabilities, and data access that can command meaningful premiums over underlying AI tokens.

We are incredibly lucky to be in an industry with deflationary economics on the supply side. Over time, your raw materials get cheaper. You don't have to raise prices in perpetuity like many industries—you actually get more efficiency gains over time.

As long as you find ways to not be so greedy that your pricing is offensive—look at Cursor, Replit, these are $20-50 per month, which feels reasonable—and we know in 10 years we'll probably drive down raw material costs, but we won't command lower prices because it's within reasonable spend.

## Why Startups Win: The Core vs. Context Framework

If AI keeps growing over the next five years, won't companies just build all their software internally instead of hiring Box to do jobs?

There's a concept from Geoffrey Moore called "core versus context." Every company decides what's core to their business versus context. If you're Disney, core is designing amazing IP and characters. Context is your HR system.

Disney needs to get really good at technology for Pixar, but they don't need to innovate on their HR department. They just need to pay people on time.

Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you should. Most people say, "Cool, I could build an HR system, or I could negotiate with Workday to lower pricing." But three years from now, there might be a bug that pays people the wrong amount. I don't want to call my IT team at midnight to fix that. I want to call a company I can sue if they mess up, or switch to a competitor.

You don't want that liability for things that are context. Most companies won't do custom software for context functions, even if they can.

## Advice for the Next Generation of Founders

This is an audience of college students, grad students, recent grads. Many want to do startups. What's your advice in this new world?

**Read these three books:**
1. **Innovator's Dilemma** - probably the number one business book of all time
2. **Crossing the Chasm** - one of the top five business books ever  
3. **Blue Ocean Strategy**

If you do what's in those books and go after the B2B market, you'll be 10 times better off than startups starting from scratch. You'll understand markets, disruption, which incumbents are vulnerable and which aren't.

**Have an incredible founding team.** Solo founders happen, but try to grab one friend—even the least technical friend. Just be in the grind with somebody because you'll have more fun and see through difficult times together.

**Don't underestimate the need for tailwinds in your market.** Make sure you're going after a market where AI fundamentally changes the economics or actual process. Always ride a tailwind.

**Now is the moment. This window will end.** In this window between a year ago and three years from now, this is when the next hundreds of great companies will get started. These windows only come every 10-20 years.

Be ambitious because in five years you can be less ambitious, but for the next four years, you've got to go big because these are the windows that give you that opportunity.
